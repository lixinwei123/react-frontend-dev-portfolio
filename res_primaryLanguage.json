I aspire to become a UX Designer as I seek to curate a visual experience, bridging the connection between creativity and technology. I am actively, curiously learning, and exploring through different experiences to broaden my knowledge of design, and social media content creation.

The shuttle can provide easy accessibility for transportation around two miles radius. Inspired by the Uber app, I, as the designer of the group create an imaginary mobile platform on an existing campus map app for students to access FrogLeap. Here, students can navigate through the instructions and schedule their desired time and date for the shuttle to arrive. Calculating the GPS location, the shuttle will estimate the wait time and give students the closest stop to their arrival location..",
